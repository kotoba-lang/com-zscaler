  "denwaban session pipeline (R0 stub).

  Binds the voice-receptionist pipeline: ingress → listen → converse → speak → book.
  The reusable kernel + port protocols live in `com-junkawasaki/koe-clj`; this cell is
  the etzhayyim public-benefit instance that injects the concrete actors
  (twilio-compat / whisper-compat / elevenlabs-compat / yotei) into those ports.

  R0: no socket, no live call, no model. `plan-session` is a PURE description of the
  pipeline (testable offline); `run-session` raises (G7 outward-gate). ADR-2606271930."
