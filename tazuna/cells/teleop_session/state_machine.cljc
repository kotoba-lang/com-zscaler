  "Phase state machine for the tazuna 手綱 teleop_session (levi) cell.
  1:1 port of cells/teleop_session/state_machine.py (ADR-2606042100).

  The defining, safety-critical tazuna skill: admit a remote teleoperation session over a physical
  robot ONLY as Transparent Force and ONLY under no-server-key, then relay member-signed actuation
  commands while a deadman / e-stop / latency budget continuously guards a safe-stop. Pure,
  unit-tested transitions; the cell's .solve() raises until Council activation.

  Invariants enforced (the load-bearing four):
    G3 — Transparent Force: no grant without a force-authorization reference (1 SBT=1 vote).
    G4 — no-server-key: serverHeldKey=false + an encrypted-envelope REFERENCE only; every actuation
         command is member-signed and a server signature is refused (ADR-2605231525).
    G10 — soft-RT supervision: a deadman lapse / latency-budget breach forces a safe-stop /
          autonomy-fallback; an e-stop is always honoured. NOT a certified safety system.
    N1  — force class: :weaponizable is unrepresentable; only the three admitted classes pass.

  Conventions: dataclass SessionState → a plain map with the SAME string field keys the Python
  `cs.__dict__` round-trips; phase enum value identities stay strings; ValueError → ex-info."
