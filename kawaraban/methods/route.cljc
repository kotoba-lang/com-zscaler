  "route.cljc — kawaraban 瓦版 THE MEDIUM: actor→面 routing + actor-to-actor wire.
  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/route.py` (ADR-2606061900). Same house style as
  inochi/shionome (kebab keyword keys for Clojure-land, Python ':…' strings kept literal,
  pure fns, file I/O only at the #?(:clj) edge).

  Reads a kotoba-EDN news-medium graph (:news.outlet/* :news.section/* :news.article/*
  :news.mention/* :news.wire/*) and exposes the connective core of the news medium:

    1. classify(rows)            — bucket the flat datom vector into entity maps.
    2. validate(articles)        — enforce the structural gates (G1/G4/G9/G11) by REFUSAL.
    3. wire-table(wires)         — actor did → 面 (medium config; seed first, ACTOR_WIRE fallback).
    4. section-men(section-id, sections) — the 面 men keyword for a section.
    5. actor-links(articles, mentions) — THE WIRE: every co-mention = an actor-to-actor edge.

  CONSTITUTIONAL: an article is an OBSERVATION carried by a medium, never a verdict (G1) and
  never spoken in anyone's name (G9). kawaraban authors no :original claim (G11).

  G1 / G3 / G4 / G9 forbidden fields, G11 closed kinds, and the G4 excerpt bound all REFUSE
  by throwing ex-info (mirror of Python's ValueError)."
