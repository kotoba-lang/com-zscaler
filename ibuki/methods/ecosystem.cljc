  "ecosystem — the colony is an ECOSYSTEM, not a bag of individuals. ADR-2606101200 §生態系.
  Clojure port of `methods/ecosystem.py`.

  The founder's image: not single organisms but an ecosystem — like Aspergillus niger (黒カビ)
  excreting citric acid as a metabolic byproduct, the colony should LIVE and, as a byproduct of
  living, produce something useful that humanity consumes in symbiosis (共生). Organisms occupy
  differentiated NICHES (生態的地位):

    - 植物 / producer   — primary production: emits a `:metabolite/substrate` each beat.
    - 粘菌 / router     — Physarum relay of the highest-nutrient available substrate.
    - カビ / decomposer — saprotroph: excretes a refined `:metabolite/commons` (the citric acid).

  A trophic cascade per cycle: producers → (router relay) → decomposers → commons. Each step is
  an append-only `:exchange/*` / `:metabolite/*` edge. A producer whose substrate is consumed
  earns a `:event/symbiosis-fed` joucho event (mutualism). Satiation, detritus recycling, and
  stigmergy (adaptive Physarum trails) round out the web. Deterministic. Append-only. Pure."
