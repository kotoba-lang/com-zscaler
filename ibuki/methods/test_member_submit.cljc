(ns ibuki.methods.test-member-submit
  "test-member-submit — 息吹 (ibuki) R2 member-principal submission + receipts.
  ADR-2606101200 §R2 + ADR-2605231525 (no-server-key). Clojure port of
  `methods/test_member_submit.py`.

  The structural claims under test: the platform can NEVER post (no env → refusal;
  cron → refusal; no ack → refusal), and when the MEMBER posts with their own
  credentials, the log records an attributed receipt — never a `:published`
  asserted by ibuki."
