  "ibuki 息吹 — Wave-4 feedback that closes the Kaizen loop.
  Clojure port of `methods/kaizen_feedback.py` (ADR-2606101200).

  Closes Gap 7 of the organism autonomy survey (\"Kaizen is fire-and-forget:
  proposals flow out, nothing flows back\"). The kotodama Kaizen observer emits
  KaizenProposal NDJSON and the (already existing) PR agent drafts
  human-reviewed PRs; what was missing is the RETURN edge — did the proposal
  merge? was it rejected? — folded back into durable state so the observer
  LEARNS.

    - read-proposals    KaizenProposal NDJSON lines ({:proposal-id :rule …})
    - read-outcomes     outcome records ({:proposal-id :rule :outcome ∈
                        merged|rejected|pending}) — written by the operator /
                        PR-agent runner from `gh pr view` results (never by
                        ibuki reaching out to GitHub)
    - fold              per-rule stats incl. CONSECUTIVE rejections
    - suppression       rules with ≥ suppress-after consecutive rejections are
                        suppressed for suppress-beats beats (the observer stops
                        re-proposing what humans keep declining — that is the
                        learning)
    - should-emit       the observer-side gate
    - feedback-datoms   `:kaizen.rule/*` checkpoints on the kotoba log (as-of
                        history of what the colony learned about its own
                        proposals)

  Outcomes also feed the organism mood: `mood-events` maps merged →
  :event/kaizen-merged, rejected → :event/kaizen-rejected (joucho) —
  acceptance literally calms the colony. Deterministic. Human review stays the
  decision-maker (ADR-2605240200: auto-apply is rejected; the loop closes
  through people, the LEARNING closes through the log)."
