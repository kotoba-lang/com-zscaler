  "member-submit — 息吹 (ibuki) R2: the member-principal live-posting runtime.
  ADR-2606101200 §R2. Clojure port of `methods/member_submit.py`.

  The Wave-3 drainer (drainer.cljc) prepares member-sign-ready envelopes and structurally
  cannot post. THIS namespace is the other half: the runtime a MEMBER runs, with the
  member's OWN credentials, to sign and submit those envelopes to the member's OWN PDS.
  The no-server-key invariant (ADR-2605231525) is kept structural, not waived, by
  construction:

    - credentials come ONLY from the member's runtime env (IBUKI_MEMBER_HANDLE /
      IBUKI_MEMBER_APP_PASSWORD / IBUKI_MEMBER_PDS) at invocation time — nothing is
      committed, cached, or platform-held; missing env → member-signature-required;
    - it REFUSES to run in a scheduled/cron context (IBUKI_CRON=1 → refusal): a platform
      CronJob may never hold member credentials. This is the member at their own keyboard
      (the karakuri/okaimono member-principal model), not the platform acting;
    - submission still flows through `drainer/submit` — the same injected-signer +
      explicit-operator-ack gate the structural tests pin down;
    - ibuki itself never asserts :published. Submission produces RECEIPTS (receipts.cljc)
      attributed to the member — `:receipt/status :submitted-by-member` — which is what
      actually happened.

  Per the founder direction of 2026-06-10 the Council gate is exercised as PR review+merge:
  this code path is complete to the end; *running* it remains a member's explicit act.

  HTTP is an INJECTABLE transport (`*transport*` dynamic var or the `:transport` option
  key) defaulting to a babashka/JVM implementation (`babashka.http-client` + `cheshire`,
  loaded lazily via requiring-resolve — the infer.cljc pattern). Environment reads go
  through the injectable `*env*` edge (nil → the real process env; a map → the test env),
  so the refusal paths are exercisable exactly as the Python tests exercise os.environ."
