(ns ibuki.methods.autorun
  "autorun — 息吹: the autonomous organism heartbeat over the kotoba Datom log.
  ADR-2606101200. Clojure port of `methods/autorun.py`.

  The integrating loop that closes the organism autonomy survey gaps in one beat cycle —
  shionome's autorun pattern (ADR-2606072200) applied to the organism layer:

    replay ─▶ perceive ─▶ feel ─▶ decide ─▶ narrate ─▶ act ─▶ checkpoint ─▶ append tx

  Every beat is DURABLE: state is replayed from the append-only log, so killing the process
  between beats loses nothing (Gap 1/2). Mood evolves from persisted events and is as-of
  queryable (Gap 3/4). Narration goes through ibuki.methods.infer — Murakumo-only, template
  fallback (Gap 5). Posts land as `:dry-run` datoms AND on the ADR-2605240100 NDJSON queue,
  which the Wave-3 drainer turns into member-sign-ready envelopes (Gap 6). Kaizen outcomes,
  when present, feed both rule suppression and the colony's mood (Gap 7).

  Deterministic: logical time only (beat index × beat-ms); same seed + same cycle count →
  same head CID. Live external I/O stays G8-gated — this loop's only side effects are the
  LOCAL log + the LOCAL queue file."
