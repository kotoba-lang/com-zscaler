  "tadori 辿 — darkweb / onion-service PASSIVE observation model. ADR-2605301400 §D2.

  SCOPE (hard boundary, by construction):
    - tadori ingests PUBLIC, PASSIVE darkweb threat-intel only: a known-malicious `.onion`
      address is itself a public indicator (ransomware C2 / mixer endpoint / market), the same
      way a malicious domain is. These enter as `:tadori.onion/*` observation datoms.
    - tadori does NOT de-anonymize Tor, does NOT run hidden-service correlation attacks, does
      NOT crawl/scrape darkweb content, and holds NO capability to unmask an onion's real IP.
      Those verbs are UNREPRESENTABLE here — there is no real-IP field on an onion observation;
      a hidden-service↔host link can only ever arrive as case-authorized, ENCRYPTED external
      evidence (G6), never derived by this actor.
    - G1 public-source + G7 evidence-only + G10 no-mass-surveillance hold by construction.

  What it DOES do: hold the public onion indicator, and — under an active case — correlate an
  onion service with an on-chain crypto address when the *case evidence* already binds them
  (e.g. a ransom-payment address published on the C2). That correlation is an attribution edge
  (see tadori.methods.attribution), not a de-anonymization.

  Pure (no I/O, no Tor, no network)."
