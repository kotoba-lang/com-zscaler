  "tadori 辿 — BTC / ETH address validation + chain inference + normalization.
  ADR-2605301400. Pure (no I/O). Used by the risk-ingest + tracing engines to reject
  malformed input before any address becomes a tracked subject.

  Honest limit (R0): cryptographic checksum verification (BTC base58check double-sha256 /
  ETH EIP-55 keccak-256) needs primitives babashka's stdlib does not ship (keccak-256 ≠
  JVM SHA3-256). This module does STRUCTURAL validation (prefix / charset / length) which
  reliably rejects malformed addresses; full checksum verification is the operator/live leg."
