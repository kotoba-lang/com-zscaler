(ns tadori.methods.adversary
  "tadori 辿 — watch-the-watchers: a transparent, attributed ledger of actors that ATTACK /
  access / surveil etzhayyim, or attempt hidden influence. ADR-2605301400 + Charter §1.12.

  DOCTRINE — this is the operational form of 相互監視 + 神の監視 + NEVER-a-throne:
    監視しようとするものを監視する (watch those who try to watch us) — but RECIPROCALLY and
    TRANSPARENTLY, never as a hidden throne. An adversary observation is appended to the
    public, append-only, on-chain-monitorable ledger (永久記憶 = no erasure): the attacker is
    SEEN, by the same light that sees us. The watcher is itself watched (silenTadoriReview),
    so this cannot degenerate into a panopticon (the 五人組→隣組→Stasi→社会信用 series is
    structurally barred — see G-no-deanon below).

  PUBLISHABLE vs ENCRYPTED (the 公開 boundary, charter-grounded):
    - PUBLIC (公開): the BEHAVIOR (attack/scan/surveil/hidden-influence), the on-chain ADDRESS
      involved, the disclosed source, and AGGREGATE/structural findings. Disclosing that we
      were attacked, from what address, is reciprocal symmetry — affirmed (ADR-2606082400).
    - ENCRYPTED + case-gated (G6/G3): any link to a NATURAL PERSON. Doxxing is forbidden
      (G1/G10). The schema has NO real-IP / identity field on an adversary observation; a
      person-linkage can only exist as a com.etzhayyim.encrypted.* attribution edge.
    - NEVER an enforcement verb (G7): recording + disclosing is the response, not retaliation.
      Force is separated to the 1 SBT = 1 vote Transparent-Force path.

  Pure (no I/O)."
