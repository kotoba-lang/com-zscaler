(ns tadori.methods.malak-ingest
  "tadori 辿 — the malak → tadori seam (T1 of ADR-2605301400 §D3, tadori half).
  Lexicon: com.etzhayyim.tadori.traceReport.

  ARCHITECTURE (the user's own point: darkweb/onion *tracking* is malak's; tadori is the
  durable graph). malak 魔来 runs the active pursuit super-steps (wallet_deep_inspect_pursuit /
  address_label_pursuit / onion-ransomware tracking, ADR-2605152000/2605172000) in its OWN
  repo. It emits a `traceReport`. THIS seam consolidates that report into tadori's durable,
  case-anchored kotoba graph — but tadori does NOT blindly trust it:

    - tadori RE-DERIVES clusters from the report's txs itself (trace/trace-case). The durable
      graph is tadori's OWN derivation; malak's clusters are advisory provenance. tadori is the
      system-of-record (G4); malak is the compute source.
    - findings that link to a person/IP/device/onion-host become ENCRYPTED attribution edges
      (G6, via attribution/attribution-datoms — throws on plaintext PII).
    - external sources malak used are recorded as feature-flagged-input ONLY, never SoR (G4).
    - consolidation is LIVE-write ⇒ requires an ACTIVE case (G3); no case → Phase-0 returns the
      derivation but the caller must not persist live.
    - non-adjudicating + evidence-only (G7): a trace-report records a derivation + its evidence,
      never a verdict or an enforcement action.

  Pure (no I/O). The live transact is the operator+case-gated edge (methods/transact)."
