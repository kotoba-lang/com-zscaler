  "tadori 辿 — high-risk / scam / sanctioned address ingest + risk propagation + hidden-influence
  concentration. ADR-2605301400 §D1/§D2.

  DOCTRINE (charter-grounded, not just policy):
    NON-ADJUDICATING (G7 + kosatsu pattern). tadori NEVER declares an address a scammer. It
    records an ATTRIBUTED, as-of event: \"asserter X listed this address as :scam\". The risk
    label is a disclosed fact (神の監視 = record what is disclosed), never tadori's verdict
    (NEVER-a-throne — the actor does not sit as judge). Divergence between asserters is itself a
    neutral fact, like kosatsu's competing-claim model.
    OPEN-SOURCE SoR (G4). A vendor/feature-flagged feed may be an input but NEVER the
    system-of-record; public lists (OFAC SDN crypto, public scam DBs) are SoR-eligible.
    EVIDENCE-ONLY (G7). A label has a confidence + evidence CID; it has no freeze/seize verb.
    Address-level only here — person-linkage is the ENCRYPTED, case-gated attribution edge (G6).

  Pure (no I/O). Live ingest of real public lists is the operator-gated leg (methods/transact)."
