  "Validation of eth-checksummed? — the EIP-55 checksum-PRESENCE detector in tadori's address
  parser, which had no test. It is honestly a presence check, NOT full verification: keccak-256
  (the EIP-55 hash) is not in babashka's stdlib, so the function returns truthy iff a structurally
  valid ETH address carries mixed-case hex (a checksum is present), and falsy for all-lower /
  all-upper / malformed. This pins that contract against the four canonical EIP-55 reference
  addresses AND locks the honest limit: a case-corrupted (but still mixed-case) address still reads
  as 'carrying a checksum' — presence ≠ correctness, so nobody mistakes this for verification."
