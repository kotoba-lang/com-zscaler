(ns kadode.tests.test-analyze
  "kadode 門出 — analyzer + UPL-boundary tests (ADR-2606112238). 1:1 Clojure port of the PURE
  assertions of tests/test_analyze.py.

  Verifies the constitutional invariants empirically:
    - graph loads (nodes + 縁), seed is non-trivial, no dangling 縁
    - G1 (THE defining boundary): EVERY negotiation-needing scenario resolves to a NEGOTIATING
      route (union/lawyer) — NEVER to 使者/self; the 使者/self routes are never can-negotiate
    - every scenario reaches a recommended lawful route
    - every employer-risk pattern has at least one countering legal ground
    - edge-primary (N1/G2): ground-support is the integral of incident :supported-by edges,
      and NO stored per-node :bond/* key exists
    - grounds carry a public source URL + a citation

  NOTE on scope: the Python test_analyze additionally exercises the `datom_emit` sibling
  (test_datom_emit_ground_and_transient + test_determinism). Those two assertions depend on
  the unported `datom_emit` module, so they are intentionally DEFERRED here (the datom_emit
  port is a separate unit, mirroring the inochi/rasen precedent). All PURE analyze assertions
  are ported 1:1."
