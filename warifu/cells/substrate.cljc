(ns warifu.cells.substrate
  "warifu substrate port — the DI seam between cells and kotoba/@etzhayyim/sdk.

  1:1 port of `cells/substrate.py` (the subset the refund cell needs + the
  loud-failing default). R0 scaffold (ADR-2605302000). Cells depend on the
  `SubstratePort` protocol, never on a concrete client. In production an
  `@etzhayyim/sdk`-backed adapter is injected (R1); tests inject an in-memory
  fake. Per ADR-2605231525 no platform key is held; money never lives in the
  cells — `reverse_settlement` emits ERC-4337 UserOps via the adapter.

  Conventions (yobel/ports.cljc + mimamori/methods/bond.cljc house style):
    - SubstratePort as a Clojure defprotocol (the Python `Protocol`)
    - UnwiredSubstrate as a defrecord whose every method throws ex-info — the
      sentinel that fails loudly so a forgotten injection never silently
      settles money (Python `NotImplementedError`)
    - settlement/refund maps use STRING keys verbatim from the Python payload
      (\"amount_usdc\"/\"refunded_usdc\"/\"funding\"/…) — not kebab keywords —
      because they are kotoba payload dict keys, not Clojure structural keys
    - EAVT facts are [E A V T] vectors (kotoba write contract), A is the
      \"warifu/…\" string attribute verbatim")

;; ── SubstratePort (Python Protocol → Clojure protocol) ────────────

;; Grown incrementally as cells are ported: the refund subset
;; (load_settlement/reverse_settlement/write_facts) plus the authorize subset
;; (resolve_card/usdc_balance/credit_available/place_hold). The remaining Python
;; Protocol surface (load_hold/record_capture/settle_transfer/open_dispute) is
;; added when capture/settle/dispute are ported.
