(ns kosatsu.methods.bridge
  "bridge.py — 高札 (kosatsu) cross-actor SoS composition. ADR-2606072000.
  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/bridge.py`.

  kosatsu is the competing-claim BOARD; the SoS intel value comes from composing its divergence
  view with the sibling accountability/intel actors over the SHARED kotoba Datom log. This module
  computes the JOIN KEYS kosatsu exposes so a downstream actor can link a designation subject to
  its other observations — WITHOUT kosatsu reaching into another actor's graph (each actor owns its
  own datoms; bridge only emits the keys).

    - tadori 辿   : a :designated-wallet subject → on-chain attribution case (authorized only)
    - keizu 系図  : a :designated-org/entity subject → public power-relations node (if public role)
    - tsumugi 紡ぎ: a subject's asserter → power-entity 縁 (who designates whom, as influence)
    - kanae 鼎    : the by-authority / divergence aggregates → fiscal/atlas render
    - tasuke 助   : never — a victim-support flow is person-consented, disjoint (no auto-link)

  The bridge is MAP-ONLY (G9): it surfaces a join key for resilience/awareness/due-process, never an
  enforcement instruction. It NEVER promotes a contested designation to a verdict.

  House style: Python ':…' keyword strings stay literal strings; pure fns. (The Python `__main__`
  demo printer is omitted — note it.)"
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]

;; subject kind → the sibling actor that can further observe it (join target). Person/org subjects
;; only bridge to a PUBLIC-role actor when they are already a public power role (keizu's own G1
;; decides admissibility downstream); kosatsu only emits the key, never the link.
