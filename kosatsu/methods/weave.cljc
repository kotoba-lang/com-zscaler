  "weave.cljc — 高札 (kosatsu) competing-claim build + divergence engine. ADR-2606072000.
  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/weave.py`.

  THE HEART of the actor and the G1..G5 anchor. Given the seed designation graph it:

    1. VALIDATES every authority / subject / designation against the closed structural
       vocab. An etzhayyim-authored designation, a verdict measure (:criminal/:guilty/
       :terrorist), an asserter-less designation, a per-subject risk score, or an under-
       sourced/non-primary-sourced event is an ex-info (ValueError) — not a silent drop.
    2. WEAVES the validated records into an in-memory competing-claim graph.
    3. Computes the AGGREGATE, EDGE-PRIMARY, POLITICALLY-NEUTRAL views — there is NO
       per-subject risk/guilt/threat score anywhere; \"crime/sanction\" is asserter-
       relative BY CONSTRUCTION:
         - status-as-of (subject asserter ts)  — listed/delisted from the event log (非終末論)
         - divergence (subject)                — which asserters list / delist / are silent
         - divergence-class                    — :unanimous | :contested | :single-asserter
         - agreement-index                     — Σ contested / Σ designated subjects
         - co-designation                      — subjects sharing an asserter+program (network)

  House style: Python ':…' keyword strings stay literal strings (incl. all :*/* attrs +
  the :listed/:delisted/:contested/:unanimous/:single-asserter result strings); pure fns;
  validators throw ex-info; file I/O only at the #?(:clj) edge.

  SET-ITERATION NOTE (vs kabuto): kosatsu's weave never iterates a `set(...)` in an order-
  sensitive way. `_designated_subjects` is `sorted({...})`; `co_designation`'s `set(subs)`
  is `sorted` and the whole result list is `sorted`; `divergence`/`by_authority` iterate the
  authorities dict in INSERTION order then `sort`. So plain insertion-order tracking (array-
  map, which the graph maps already preserve from the EDN reader) suffices — no siphash/
  setobject port is needed. Deterministic."
