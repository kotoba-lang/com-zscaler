  "social.py — 高札 (kosatsu) DRY-RUN social posts. ADR-2606072000.
  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/social.py`.

  Projects the aggregate divergence/agreement findings into member-signable, NON-adjudicating
  dry-run posts. G8: status is always 'dry-run' (never published; outward-gated). G9: every post
  opens with the mirror/competing-claim disclaimer and never speaks AS an authority. G7: the server
  never signs — a real post requires a member signature (serverHeldKey false). G2: a post reports
  who-designated-whom + disagreement, never a verdict.

  House style: Python ':…' keyword strings stay literal strings; pure fns; throws ex-info on a gate;
  file I/O only behind #?(:clj …). (The Python `__main__` demo printer is omitted — note it.)"
