(ns kosatsu.methods.analyze
  "analyze.cljc — 高札 (kosatsu) end-to-end dry-run → methods/out/intel-report.md. ADR-2606072000.
  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/analyze.py`.

  Loads the :representative seed, weaves the competing-claim graph, and renders an aggregate-first,
  NON-adjudicating Markdown report whose headline is the DIVERGENCE view: where jurisdictions
  disagree about a designation. Every line is an ATTRIBUTED mirror ('asserter A listed S'), never
  a verdict of ours. Writes nothing live (G8) — output is a local file only.

  This is the thin dry-run DRIVER: load (kosatsu.methods.edn/load-edn) → weave + report
  (kosatsu.methods.weave) → render → write. It reuses the already-ported core modules verbatim;
  it does NOT reimplement edn or weave.

  House style: Python ':…' keyword strings stay literal strings; pure fns (render is pure over the
  woven graph); file I/O only at the #?(:clj) edge."

  0.2 not 0.2 ... Clojure's (str 0.2) already gives \"0.2\". For an exact integer-valued ratio
