(ns kosatsu.methods._t
  "_t.py — tiny standalone test harness (no pytest needed) — shared by kosatsu test_*.py.
  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/_t.py`.

  NOTE: the .cljc test ports (test_consistency.cljc / test_lexicons.cljc /
  test_charter_invariants.cljc / test_autorun.cljc) use clojure.test directly rather than this
  harness — `run`/`expect-raises` are kept here only for parity with the Python `_t.run` /
  `_t.expect_raises` API. Pure (the Python sys.exit / traceback printing is host I/O, kept behind
  #?(:clj …); cljs callers get the {:passed :failed} return value)."
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]))

  "Run a seq of [name fn] cases. A case passes if it returns without throwing; failures are printed
  and (on :clj) the process exits non-zero. Returns {:passed n :failed n}. Mirrors _t.run."
