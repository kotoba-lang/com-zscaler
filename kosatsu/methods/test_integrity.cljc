  "Validation of weave.cljc's referential-integrity check — check-integrity / assert-integrity,
  which guard the kosatsu invariant that every sanctions/crime DESIGNATION's asserter (the
  authority making the claim) and subject (who it is about) resolves to a real node in the graph.
  assert-integrity was ISOLATED (no test). A dangling ref means a competing-claim observation
  attributed to — or about — a non-existent entity, which would silently corrupt the divergence
  computation; this pins that the check finds every dangling asserter/subject and that
  assert-integrity refuses such a graph."
