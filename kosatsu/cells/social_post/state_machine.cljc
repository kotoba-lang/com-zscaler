  "Phase state machine for the 高札 (kosatsu) social_post cell — the G2/G7/G8/G9 publication membrane.
  1:1 port of cells/social_post/state_machine.py (ADR-2606072000).

  A divergence finding enters; it is DRAFTED into a dry-run post ONLY if:
    G3 — ≥2 primary-source citations are present;
    G9 — the post is a mirror (isMirror), opening with the competing-claim disclaimer;
    G7 — server-held-key is false (the member signs, the server never does);
    G8 — the status is dry-run (a 'published' request REFUSES — live needs Council Lv6+ + operator);
    G2 — non-adjudicating (the body reports who-designated-whom + disagreement, never a verdict).
  Self-contained. Conventions: dataclass PostState → a plain map with the SAME string field keys the
  Python `cs.__dict__` round-trips; phase enum value identities stay strings."
