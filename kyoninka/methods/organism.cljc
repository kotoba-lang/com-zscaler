(ns kyoninka.methods.organism
  "kyoninka 許認可 — the autonomous-publication cell, built on the kototama
  common organism library (orgs/com-junkawasaki/kototama-clj). Per the 種をまく
  doctrine (ADR-2606281500) kyoninka PUBLISHES its deployment-readiness digest
  autonomously — no per-post operator prior restraint — bounded by the seed:
  a revocable member CACAO leash, the Rider §2 content scan, and the append-only
  public kotoba log. PUBLICATION ≠ ACTUATION: this cell only SPEAKS the
  assessment; the robotaxi launch sign-off (manifest G3) and no-permit-grant
  (G1) stay human-gated.

  Run (classpath spans this actor + the kototama lib):
    bb --classpath 20-actors:../../com-junkawasaki/kototama-clj/src -e \\
