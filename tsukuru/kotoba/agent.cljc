(ns tsukuru.kotoba.agent
  "tsukuru 作 — B2B factory-direct ordering cell (moved from py/ — legacy Python-era dir name;
  the actor is pure .cljc now, living alongside its kotoba data). Four handlers over the
  production lifecycle: handle-discover (spec → capability-match factory candidates), handle-
  compliance (G16 treaty + yabai screening + HS classification + export-control pre-screen, never
  auto-pass), handle-production (BTO/MTO/CTO order state machine, G14 member-principal, G2
  SBT-gated), handle-qc (pass/fail→quarantine/rework), + build-settlement-intent (G7 10% tithe,
  :intent unless member-signed G15). Pure compute; the Murakumo llm rerank (_llm_rank_factories)
  is the omitted leg — a no-op when llm is absent. classify-product/screen-export-control are
  curated-heuristic pre-screens (HS-CLASSIFICATION-TABLE / EXPORT-CONTROL-CATEGORIES) — same
  honest-stub idiom as screen-entity/resolve-treaty: real integrations inject a fn; the default
  never silently fabricates a pass. validate-run-package brings the CNT and EUV industrial
  verticals (00-contracts run-package/run-validation schemas + lexicons) to genuine executable
  parity: real business-rule checks over a run-package map (required-approval signatures,
  closed-loop telemetry/EHS-interlock presence, release-plan numeric targets, catalog step
  coverage for CNT; numeric technology-node/wafer-diameter/numerical-aperture + CAD/CAM
  handoff completeness for EUV), never just key presence. factory-datom->state bridges a kotoba
  :factory/* EDN entity (kotoba/seed.edn's 3-entry demo, or the broader illustrative real-company
  kotoba/manufacturer-registry-seed.edn) into the plain string-keyed shape handle-discover/
  capability-match already expect — no change to the matching logic itself."
