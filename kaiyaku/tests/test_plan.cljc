  "kaiyaku 解約 — severance-plan tests (ADR-2606112201). 1:1 Clojure port of tests/test_plan.py.

  Verifies the executor gates empirically:
    - safest-first tier routing: api → T1, browser-permitted → T2, else T3
    - G3: a :prohibited/:unknown browser stance NEVER yields T2; evasion verbs raise
    - cascade ties plan a rehome-dependency step FIRST
    - G8: notice/penalty are carried into the plan (cost-of-severance honesty)
    - G5/G6: every plan demands member-sig + dry-run + Council gate; execute raises
    - only :sever / :review-cascade ties are plannable (:keep refuses)"
