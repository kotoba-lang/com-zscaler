  "kaiyaku 解約 — R1 cancellation-procedure catalog tests (ADR-2606112201 R1).

  Proves the catalog's honesty gates and its cross-consistency with the planner:
    - the committed catalog validates clean (required keys, G3/G6/G8 invariants)
    - G3: catalog derive-tier == plan/select-tier for EVERY entry (no drift between
      the data layer and the routing logic); a non-:permitted browser stance is never T2
    - G6: every entry is operator-verified=false + sourcing :representative
    - G8: every entry carries numeric notice-days + penalty-jpy; the Adobe entry surfaces
      a non-zero early-termination fee (cost-of-severance honesty)
    - N1: every entry id is a service, never a person
    - validate actually catches a planted bad entry (evasion verb / T2-over-prohibited)"
