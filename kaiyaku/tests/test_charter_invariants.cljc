(ns kaiyaku.tests.test-charter-invariants
  "kaiyaku 解約 — CONSOLIDATED charter-invariant tests (ADR-2606112201, the ibuki
  test_charter_invariants pattern). The per-module suites test each piece; this
  file pins the ACTOR'S CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES in one authoritative place, so a
  regression in any module that weakened a hard gate is caught here too.

  Invariants asserted across the whole R1 leg:
    G3  — detection-evasion is structurally unrepresentable (plan); ToS-honest
    G5  — severance needs a member capability (driver refuses without one)
    G6  — NO live execution path: plan/execute raises; no descriptor/receipt is
          ever executed=true; the audit log verifies clean
    G3/no-server-key — a credential is never stored in a receipt; never server-signed
    G8  — cost-of-severance is carried (catalog notice/penalty are numbers)
    N1  — a tie target is always a SERVICE, never a person (no :person/* anywhere)"
