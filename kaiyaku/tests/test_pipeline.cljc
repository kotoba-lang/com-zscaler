  "kaiyaku 解約 — R1 END-TO-END pipeline test (ADR-2606112201 R1).

  One integration that threads analyze→plan→enrich→dispatch→serviceop→receipt over a
  minimal in-memory ledger, proving the seven R1 pieces COMPOSE (and catches interface
  drift any single change would introduce). Uses a 2-tie graph:
    - 'netflix'           (cancel api :none / browser :prohibited) → T3 → member-submits, no op
    - 'generic-saas-api'  (cancel api :available)                  → T1 → karakuri ServiceOp
  both real catalog ids (so enrichment fires), both member-approved in the capability."
