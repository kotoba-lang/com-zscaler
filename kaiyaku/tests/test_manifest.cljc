  "kaiyaku 解約 — manifest↔implementation parity tests (ADR-2606112201 R1).

  The manifest documents the actor; these pin it to the code so the doc can't drift:
    - every file the :actor/r1 block references (method / tool / data) EXISTS on disk
    - :actor/adapter-tiers ids == the karakuri-bridge tier->adapter scheme (manifest↔code)
    - those tier ids also map onto karakuri's OWN serviceOp lexicon enum (manifest↔karakuri)
    - the cancel_execute cell (the driver-backed execution cell) is declared"
