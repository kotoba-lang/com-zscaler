  "chie 智慧 cell entry — kotodama-cell-runner contract (ADR-2605192415 §7.1).

  Registered in 50-infra/cluster/murakumo/cell-runner/cells.edn as
  ChieHeartbeatCell (node gad, cron 37 * * * *, healthz 13082). `fire` runs ONE
  deterministic heartbeat (ADR-2606171200 / pattern 2606091000):

      load AI-ecosystem seed → analyze (edge-primary 取-concentration) → aggregate
      coverage + opening headline → ONE content-addressed tx appended to the
      actor-local kotoba commit-DAG → chain verified.

  NO external I/O — the live ingest legs (regulator texts / disclosed rounds /
  Wikidata) remain G7-gated. The returned summary is aggregate-only (G5): counts,
  CIDs, and the single top opening-priority headline, never a per-entity score."
