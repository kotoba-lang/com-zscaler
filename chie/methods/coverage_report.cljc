  "chie 智慧 — honest coverage + gap map (G5, ADR-2606171200).

  Coverage of the global AI ecosystem is ~0 by design: the committed seed is a BOUNDED
  representative sample, not a census. This makes that measurable and names the gaps so no
  reader mistakes the seed for exhaustive coverage (no fabricated coverage). It reports:

    - node counts per :organism/kind and per :ai/sector
    - :authoritative vs :representative split (sourcing honesty)
    - edge counts per :en/kind
    - open vs closed accumulator split
    - a worklist of structural gaps (kinds/axes thin or absent) routed to next ingest.

  Pure fns; reuses chie.methods.analyze. Portable .cljc."
