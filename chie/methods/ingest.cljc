  "chie 智慧 — DISCLOSED-source ingest adapter + G7 live-leg gate (ADR-2606171200).

  Grounds the representative graph in PRIMARY DISCLOSURE: each disclosed funding-round
  record upgrades the matching round stub to :organism/sourcing :authoritative, attaches
  the disclosed :ai/round-amount-usd, and records :en/disclosed-src provenance on the
  round's structural edges. This is the offline stand-in for the planet-scale live leg.

  G7 (the gate this implements, previously only declared): `ingest-live` REFUSES unless
  CHIE_INGEST_LIVE=1 AND an operator DID is supplied — live planet-scale ingest is
  Council+operator-gated. The offline `ingest-file` does no network I/O and is always safe.

  Honest scope (kanjō/ake pattern): a READ over a disclosed-source fixture + an offline
  merge. DISCLOSED figures are recorded as facts, never valuation verdicts (N3/G4). Dedup
  is idempotent: re-ingesting the same fixture is a no-op (id-keyed merge / upgrade-only).

  Pure fns; file I/O only at the #?(:clj) edge; deterministic."
