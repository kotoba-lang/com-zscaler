  "chie 智慧 — knowledge-graph query tests (ADR-2606171200). Verifies the practical
  observatory queries over the loaded graph:
    - funders-of / compute-suppliers-of / governed-by return the right sources
    - rounds-of finds the disclosed round nodes linked to a lab
    - subsidiaries resolves :organism/nests-in
    - concentration-in / opening-worklist agree with the analyze integral (one source of truth)
    - opening-worklist never surfaces an OPEN accumulator at the top (G1, not a winner-rank)"
