  "chie 智慧 — DISCLOSED-source ingest + G7 gate tests (ADR-2606171200). Verifies:
    - the fixture parses into disclosed records
    - ingest UPGRADES the representative round stubs to :authoritative + attaches the
      disclosed :ai/round-amount-usd, with :en/disclosed-src provenance on edges
    - idempotent: re-ingesting the same fixture adds nothing (no node/edge growth)
    - G7: ingest-live REFUSES without CHIE_INGEST_LIVE + operator DID (g7-violation?)
    - DISCLOSED amount is recorded as a fact (no valuation/score attr introduced)"
