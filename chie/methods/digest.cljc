  "chie 智慧 — Murakumo-only digest narration of the opening-priority readout
  (ADR-2606171200 + ADR-2605215000). Two paths, one invariant:

    - `template-digest` — deterministic, offline narration (the R0/R1 default and the
      fail-open fallback). Pure, replay-safe; this is what the heartbeat emits.
    - `narrate` — LIVE narration via the Murakumo fleet ONLY (LiteLLM loopback /
      EVO-X2 LAN / per-node Ollama), gated by CHIE_MURAKUMO_LIVE=1. Any other endpoint
      throws (murakumo-only-violation? — ADR-2605215000). Live failure falls back to the
      template (fail-open). HTTP is injectable; this namespace loads on any host.

  The digest is NARRATION, never a verdict: it describes the aggregate opening readout
  (who most needs OPENING, by axis) — it does NOT grade capability or forecast (G1/G4)."
