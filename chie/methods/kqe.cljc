(ns chie.methods.kqe
  "chie 智慧 — Datalog read path over the REAL kotoba engine (ADR-2606171200 + 2605262130).

  Proves the 'datomic' leg end-to-end: the seed is ingested into etzhayyim.kotoba.engine and
  queried through its Datalog `q` + Datomic-style `pull` (VAET reverse-ref navigation) over the
  four-index arrangement — NOT the in-memory traversal in chie.methods.query. Because each
  edge stores :en/from / :en/to as the STRING id of a node, and each node's :db/id IS that id,
  the engine's ref-navigation traverses edge↔node directly.

  This is a clj-only read demonstration (the engine + journal are JVM/bb host concerns); the
  pure-graph query.cljc remains the WASM-portable surface. The two AGREE (test-enforced):
  funders-of-lab via Datalog == query/funders-of via graph traversal — one source of truth.

  CONSTITUTIONAL: read-only; no narration, no verdict; G4 forbidden attrs are unrepresentable
  in the schema so they cannot appear in any query result."
