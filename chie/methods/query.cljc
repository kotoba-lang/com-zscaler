  "chie 智慧 — knowledge-graph query interface over the AI-ecosystem graph (ADR-2606171200).

  Maturity / usability: the kotoba Datom EDN is a knowledge graph, not a flat list — this
  module exposes the practical observatory queries that prove it (the point of the Datalog
  substrate). All queries are pure graph traversals over the loaded {:nodes :edges}; nothing
  is stored, nothing mutates (N1). The 取-concentration queries reuse chie.methods.analyze so
  every answer is the same on-read integral the report uses — no second source of truth.

    node / label                  — a node map / its display label
    incident (id)                 — {:inbound :outbound} 縁 of a node
    funders-of (lab)              — :invests-in sources (capital) into a lab
    compute-suppliers-of (lab)    — :compute-deal sources (compute) into a lab
    governed-by (lab)             — :governs / :sets-standard sources (policy reach) over a node
    rounds-of (lab)               — :ai.invest/round nodes linked to a lab
    subsidiaries (parent)         — nodes that :organism/nests-in the parent
    concentration-in (axis)       — ranked accumulators on one axis (compute/capital/talent/policy)
    opening-worklist              — ranked :bond/opening-priority (who most needs OPENING)

  CONSTITUTIONAL: G1 — OPENING map, never a winner-rank; queries surface accumulation routed
  to opening, never a capability/forecast verdict (N3/G4). Persons only as public-role nodes."
