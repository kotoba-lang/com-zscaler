  "chie 智慧 — coverage report tests (ADR-2606171200). Verifies sourcing honesty (G5):
    - the seed counts nodes/edges by kind and sector
    - the :authoritative/:representative split is reported (seed is all representative)
    - absent node/edge kinds are surfaced as a gap worklist (no fabricated coverage)
    - the report states coverage is ~0 by design"
