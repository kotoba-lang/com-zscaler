  "chie 智慧 — cell-runner contract tests (ADR-2606171200 / ADR-2605192415 §7.1). Verifies:
    - `fire` runs ONE heartbeat against an explicit log and returns an aggregate-only summary
    - the summary carries cycle / cid / chain-length / top-opening (no DID, no per-entity score)
    - a second `fire` advances the cycle (resume-safe; cell is idempotent per log state)"
