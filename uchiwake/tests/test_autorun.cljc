  "uchiwake 内訳 — autonomous heartbeat + kotoba Datom-log + bridge/ingest-gate invariants
  (clojure.test). ADR-2606081800.

  The heartbeat (kotoba.cljc + autorun.cljc) + the live-node push (bridge.clj) are **clj-native
  SSoT** (ADR-2606142300 D1: new logic-core is authored in Clojure, not Python-first) — so this is
  the canonical test, not a port. Guards: one content-addressed tx per beat to an append-only log;
  a verifiable commit-DAG (every CID recomputes; tamper detected); deterministic / resume-safe
  (same cycles → same CIDs); G5 derived-:synthesized; G2/G4 resilience-not-target / not-a-recipe;
  append-only :db/add; the bridge exactly-once cursor + its G7 push-gate; the ingest G7 fetch-gate.
  `cid-byte-parity-with-python` is retained as a frozen golden-value regression guard (the value the
  removed Python reference produced) per the D2.1 byte-parity bar."
