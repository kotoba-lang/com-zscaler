# uchiwake 内訳 — agent reference

> World product bill-of-materials / GTIN knowledge graph. Tier-B, R0 design-only. ADR-2606081800.
> The product-level layer beneath kabuto 兜. Read the repo-root `CLAUDE.md` first; this file only
> adds actor-local rules.

## Identity

- **DID**: `did:web:etzhayyim.com:actor:uchiwake`.
- **Glyph**: 内訳 — "itemized breakdown" — a finished good resolved into its constituent parts,
  materials, processes, transport, and design refs, made a first-class graph.
- **Role**: the *product-level* face of the observation upper layer. kabuto 兜 wires
  COMPANY → COMPANY supply edges; uchiwake goes one level down to PRODUCT → PART → raw MATERIAL,
  and one level up (ownership) to roll a brand-owning subsidiary to its ultimate parent. Brand /
  supplier / carrier / operator ids reuse kabuto's `org.corp.*` space; commodity codes reuse the
  existing UNSPSC space (entity-as-actor).

## Hard rules (constitutional — do not weaken)

1. **Resilience + transparency, not interdiction or cloning (G2).** Output is framed toward
   material/supplier diversification and corporate-power accountability. NEVER a "who to hit" map
   AND never a clone/counterfeit recipe. Quantities are bounded public estimates, never a
   manufacturer's confidential formulation. Mirrors Charter Rider §2(d) + the kabuto lineage.
2. **Public trade items, public-record data only (G1).** GTIN, brand, brand-owner, GS1 prefix,
   GPC/UNSPSC/HS classification, published material/ingredient labels, public teardown findings,
   disclosed supplier relationships. **Forbidden inputs**: confidential recipes/formulations,
   non-public commercial terms, trade secrets, consumer purchase/PII data.
3. **No adjudication (G4).** uchiwake states public facts + computed concentration. It does not
   rule on legality, safety/conformity compliance, or country-of-origin claims.
4. **Sourcing honesty (G5).** Every node/edge carries `:*/sourcing` ∈
   `:authoritative | :representative | :synthesized`. GTINs marked `:authoritative` are REAL
   public identifiers (validated by GS1 mod-10 check digit on ingest). BOM decompositions are
   `:representative` (public teardown/label, NOT an exhaustive authoritative bill of materials).
   Absence ≠ non-existence — it means "not yet ingested".
5. **kotoba-native (substrate boundary).** State = kotoba Datom log. No SQL / RisingWave / Lance.
6. **Murakumo-only (G6).** Any LLM narration routes through the Murakumo fleet (ADR-2605215000).
7. **Outward-gated INGEST (G7).** Live full-universe fetch (GS1 GDSN / GLEIF RR / Open Product
   Data — hundreds of millions of GTINs) requires `UCHIWAKE_OPERATOR_GATE=1` + Council. R0 ships
   a bounded real seed only.
8. **no-server-key + read-only (G12).** uchiwake never holds a GS1/GLEIF write credential and
   never mutates an upstream record.

## Vocabulary

`00-contracts/schemas/product-bom-ontology.kotoba.edn`:
- `:product/*` — a trade item keyed on the GTIN (normalized GTIN-14), brand, brand-owner
  (→ kabuto `:company/id`), GS1 prefix + prefix-country, GPC/UNSPSC/HS classification.
- `:part/*` — a sub-assembly / component / ingredient / packaging node.
- `:material/*` — a raw / refined material input (metal/mineral/polymer/agricultural/chemical/…).
- `:bom.edge/*` — first-class directed BOM edge: parent CONTAINS child, with qty + tier +
  disclosed supplier + bounded criticality.
- `:process.step/*` — a transformation step (extraction → refining → fab → assembly → …).
- `:logistics.leg/*` — a transport leg (origin → dest, mode, carrier).
- `:design.ref/*` — a design/standard/spec reference (IEC/ISO/JEDEC/USB-IF/regulatory).
- `:company.ownership/*` — SUBSIDIARY edge (子会社): child → parent, GLEIF Level-2 RR.
- derived `:concentration/*` — computed by `analyze.py`, flagged `:concentration/derived true`,
  **never re-ingested as fact**.

## Cells

- `cell:uchiwake.ingest` → `methods/ingest.py` — public product source → kotoba EAVT bridge
  (offline default; live G7-gated). Documents the GS1 GDSN / GLEIF RR / Open Product Data path.
  Validates the GS1 check digit before admitting any product datom.
- `cell:uchiwake.analyze` → `methods/analyze.py` (stdlib). recursive BOM material-closure →
  material dependence → processing-jurisdiction load → ultimate-parent rollup (子会社) →
  single-source/high-criticality edges. Aggregate-first. Idempotent.
- `cell:uchiwake.crosscheck` → `methods/crosscheck.py` (stdlib). resolves every uchiwake company
  reference (brand-owner/supplier/operator/carrier/ownership) against kabuto's ingested company
  universe → MEASURED linkage % + 子会社 rollup recovery + honest not-yet-ingested gap. Measures
  cross-actor supply-chain integration; does not assert it.
- `cell:uchiwake.autorun` → `methods/autorun.cljc` (+ `methods/kotoba.cljc`) — **clj-native SSoT**
  (ADR-2606142300 D1: new logic-core is authored in Clojure, no Python twin). The autonomous
  Murakumo-fleet heartbeat. Each cycle observes the OFFLINE merged product graph → recursive BOM
  material-closure → material dependence + processing-jurisdiction load + ultimate-parent rollup
  (子会社) → **persists a content-addressed transaction** (graph datoms + derived `:concentration`)
  to the append-only **local** kotoba Datom log (`methods/kotoba.cljc`), linking the previous tx's
  CID into a verifiable commit-DAG. Deterministic / resume-safe (cycle drives tx-id + as-of → same
  CIDs; derived sorted by id); NO external I/O. **G2/G4/G5 hold by construction**: only public
  trade-item facts + transparent concentration are representable — every derived `:concentration/*`
  carries `:sourcing :synthesized` + `:derived true` and is never re-ingested as an authoritative
  product fact; no target-list / clone / recipe attr exists. Live universe ingest + the live-node
  push stay Council + operator gated (G7). Invariants guarded by `tests/test_autorun.cljc`
  (commit-DAG verify, tamper-detect, determinism, append-only, G5 derived-:synthesized, G2/G4
  not-target/not-recipe, exactly-once cursor, G7 ingest+push gate-refusal, frozen golden CIDs).
- `cell:uchiwake.bridge` → `methods/bridge.clj` — **clj-native SSoT**. LOCAL→LIVE kotoba-node push
  leg (ibuki pattern): replays an exactly-once `:bridge/*` cursor off the local log, pushes only
  un-pushed heartbeat txs to the live `datomic.transact` node with `:uchiwake.tx/*` provenance,
  then appends ONE checkpoint. Gated by `UCHIWAKE_KOTOBA_LIVE=1` (Council + operator); the
  cursor/replay logic is pure and runs offline (`--status`). RFC4648 base32 graph-cid. no-server-key
  (unsigned public-DID operator bearer, G12).

### Clojure substrate (datomic + clojure)

The heartbeat (`kotoba.cljc` + `autorun.cljc`) and the live-node push (`bridge.clj`) are
**clj-native — Clojure is the source of truth, there is no Python twin** (ADR-2606142300 D1, new
logic-core authored in Clojure). The canonical-JSON tx-CID encoder in `kotoba.cljc` follows the
D2.1 content-address bar (`json.dumps(…, sort_keys=True, separators=(",",":"))`-shape, byte-stable);
golden CIDs are frozen as regression guards in `tests/test_autorun.cljc`. The `ingest`/`crosscheck`
methods + the OFF adapter remain **Python↔clj parity twins** (`ingest.{py,clj}`,
`crosscheck.{py,clj}`, `adapters/openfoodfacts.{py,clj}`) — pre-existing methods byte-parity-ported
under the additive D2.2 rule; `uchiwake_edn.cljc` tracks `::order` meta so >8-key datom maps
reproduce dict insertion order (CID parity).

## Run

```bash
cd 20-actors/uchiwake
bb -cp 20-actors -m uchiwake.methods.ingest            # offline: bridge data/ingest/*.json + seed (cljc-native; ADR-2606261200)
python3 methods/analyze.py            # → out/intel-report.md + out/product-criticality.kotoba.edn
python3 -m unittest tests.test_uchiwake -v   # 21 tests (twins: ingest/analyze/crosscheck)
# live ingest (G7-gated, twin):
UCHIWAKE_OPERATOR_GATE=1 UCHIWAKE_OPERATOR_GATE=1 bb -cp 20-actors -m uchiwake.methods.ingest --live --gtin 3017620422003  # OFF fetch (Nutella)

# clj-native heartbeat + bridge (SSoT — Clojure, no Python twin):
bb -cp 20-actors -e "(require 'uchiwake.methods.autorun)(apply uchiwake.methods.autorun/-main [\"--cycles\" \"3\" \"--fresh\"])"
bb -cp 20-actors -e "(require 'uchiwake.methods.bridge)(apply uchiwake.methods.bridge/-main [\"--status\"])"
bb -cp 20-actors -e "(require 'uchiwake.tests.test-autorun 'clojure.test)(clojure.test/run-tests 'uchiwake.tests.test-autorun)"
```

`python3 methods/analyze.py` with no argument runs the **seed** graph alone.

## Honesty (R0)

Bounded illustrative seed of **11 products** (real public GTINs: Coca-Cola 330ml `5449000000996`,
Nutella 750g `3017620422003` `:authoritative`; KitKat `7613035044289` `:representative`), **18
parts**, **26 materials**, **46 BOM edges**, **10 process steps** (incl. `:design` activity), **5
logistics legs**, **7 design refs**, **3 ownership edges** — **not** exhaustive coverage and **not**
an authoritative recipe. Brand-owners / suppliers / operators / carriers wire to REAL kabuto
companies (Apple, Foxconn, BYD, CATL, Maersk, Nestlé, Fast Retailing, TSMC, SK hynix, Kioxia, Sony,
NVIDIA, Ericsson, Boeing, ARM, SMIC, Denso, Magna, Glencore, ADM). `crosscheck.py` measures linkage
(**80.8%** of distinct refs resolve) AND reverse coverage (**6.4%** of kabuto's 233 supply-chain
companies / **1.16%** of all 1,719 have product-BOM detail) with a prioritized ingest worklist —
each `/loop` iteration ingests worklist suppliers to raise it (2.6%→6.4% this iteration). GTINs are validated by GS1 mod-10 check
digit; decompositions are `:representative` public-teardown/label estimates. "Register ALL trade
items" is the **R1** goal — full GS1 GDSN / GLEIF-RR / Open Product Data universe ingest (hundreds
of millions of GTINs) is **G7** Council + operator gated. Live atproto posting is **G11** (later).

## Live ingest — Council-authorised (2026-06-16)

The **G7 gate is OPEN** (founder Lv7+ 1/1). A bounded real **Open Food Facts** batch (CC-BY-SA)
landed via `70-tools/scripts/coverage-publish/off_batch.py` (curated `gtins.txt`): **merged graph
now 27 products** (was 11) + ~100 real materials, GTIN-validated, `:representative`. Persisted on
**DataLad + IPFS + kotobase.net** via `coverage-publish/publish.py` — IPFS CID
`bafkreib7yagcmrxzley2eyho5b2miuncm2n6rjj3tmyvlnxvkpls5ptcfq` (pinned, single-block verified),
DataLad dataset `80-data/uchiwake-coverage`, IPNS `k51qzi5uqu5dl5fz…`; kotobase = operator-follow-up
(no token, ADR-2606111330). Pointer: `80-data/coverage-manifests/uchiwake-coverage-manifest.json`.
Full GS1 GDSN universe remains the continued operator/loop process.
