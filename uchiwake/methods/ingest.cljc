(ns uchiwake.methods.ingest
  "uchiwake 内訳 — product / GTIN / BOM ingestion bridge (offline default; live G7-gated).
  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/ingest.py` (ADR-2606081800).

  Bridges public product-data sources into the kotoba Datom log as
  :product/:part/:material/:bom.edge/:process.step/:logistics.leg/:design.ref/
  :company.ownership datoms, dedup-merged with the bounded real seed (seed wins on id).

  GATES (enforced here):
    G1  public trade items + public-record data only.
    G5  every emitted datom carries :*/sourcing; bridged data defaults :representative.
    G7  live full-universe fetch requires UCHIWAKE_OPERATOR_GATE=1 (Council + operator).
        Default is OFFLINE: bridge data/ingest/*.json if present, else just the seed.
    no-server-key: read-only.

  House style (lineage): ':…' keyword strings stay strings; string-keyed maps; pure fns;
  file/network I/O behind #?(:clj) edges (json.loads / file globbing / EDN text splicing)."
