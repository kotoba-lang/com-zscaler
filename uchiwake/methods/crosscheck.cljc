(ns uchiwake.methods.crosscheck
  "uchiwake 内訳 — kabuto coverage-linkage crosscheck.
  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/crosscheck.py` (ADR-2606081800).

  uchiwake's product graph references companies (brand-owner, BOM supplier, process
  operator, logistics carrier, ownership parent/child) by kabuto :company/id in the
  shared org.corp.* space. This tool computes — does not claim — how much of that
  product graph actually WIRES INTO kabuto's ingested company universe, and surfaces
  the gap honestly (a reference that does not resolve = \"not yet ingested in kabuto\",
  NOT \"does not exist\"; G5).

  It also reports the OWNERSHIP-ROLLUP effect (子会社) and the REVERSE coverage figure.

  House style (lineage): ':…' keyword strings stay strings; string-keyed maps; pure fns;
  file I/O only at #?(:clj) edges. round() = BigDecimal HALF_EVEN on the exact double."
