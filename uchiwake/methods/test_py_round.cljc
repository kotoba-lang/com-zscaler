  "Gold-standard parity validation of py-round / py-round-2 — uchiwake's CPython round() mirror used
  to round BOM quantities and measurements. Pins it against CPython's round(x, n): banker's rounding
  (round-half-even) AND the float-representation quirks, since a drift to naive round-half-up would
  silently mis-round product quantities. Every case below was verified equal to `python3 -c
  'round(x, n)'`."
