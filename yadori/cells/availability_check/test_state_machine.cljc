  "State-machine tests for the yadori 宿り availability_check cell (R0).
  1:1 port of the availability_check portion of cells/test_state_machines.py (ADR-2606038400).
  .solve() is NOT exercised for output (it raises). The env-gated POSITIVE live case
  (operator+YADORI_ALLOW_LIVE_RDAP both present → true) needs a process env flag and is covered by
  the Python suite under monkeypatch; here we pin the G7 SAFETY property: without BOTH, live is refused."
