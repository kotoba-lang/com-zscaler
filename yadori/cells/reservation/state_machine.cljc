(ns yadori.cells.reservation.state-machine
  "Phase state machine for the yadori 宿り reservation (asher) cell.
  1:1 port of cells/reservation/state_machine.py (ADR-2606038400).

  The defining yadori skill: turn an available domain into an *unsigned, member-principal*
  reservation intent, then authorize it with a member signature only. Pure, unit-tested transitions;
  the cell's .solve() raises until Council activation.

  Invariants enforced:
    G2 — no-fiat-inflow / member-principal: the payer is the member (okaimono assisted-checkout),
         never the religious-corp / a fiat processor. yadori is never the buyer-of-record.
    G3 — cloudflare-registrar-default: Cloudflare is default; an external registrar needs a Council flag.
    G5 — no-server-key: serverHeldKey=false; authorization requires a member sig, REFUSES a server sig.
    G6 — no-squatting: held-trademark/confusable screen + no speculation/parking + Charter-Rider scan.

  Conventions: dataclass ReservationState → a plain map with the SAME string field keys the Python
  `cs.__dict__` round-trips; phase enum value identities stay strings; ValueError → ex-info."
