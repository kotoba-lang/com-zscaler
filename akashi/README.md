# akashi (証) — Public Ad-Disclosure Transparency Actor

**DID**: `did:web:akashi.etzhayyim.com`
**Namespace**: `com.etzhayyim.akashi.*`
**ADR**: ADR-2606022300 (R0 scaffold)
**Status**: R0 design scaffold (2026-06-02)

akashi is a kotoba-native actor for ingesting already-public advertising
transparency disclosures from platform ad libraries into a source-cited EAVT
graph.

It is the advertising-disclosure sibling of `danjo`: passive public records in,
non-adjudicating transparency records out.

## Scope

akashi stores public ad disclosure evidence as kotoba datoms:

- platform source policy snapshots
- advertiser identities as disclosed by source platforms
- creative text/media hashes
- delivery period, region, spend range and impression range where disclosed
- disclosed targeting summaries
- landing URL/domain/redirect/content hash evidence
- cross-platform factual links by source ID, advertiser, landing domain or
  creative hash

## Malak Boundary

akashi is not part of `malak`. malak is confidential CTI and agency-referral
infrastructure. akashi is public transparency infrastructure.

The only allowed bridge is `malakEvidenceCandidate`: a reviewed, source-cited,
non-adjudicating evidence package when a public ad disclosure intersects already
known phishing, malware, brand-abuse or fraud indicators.

## R0 Cells

These cells are present as gated scaffolds under
`/40-engine/kotoba/crates/kotoba-kotodama/cells/akashi_*`. Each one raises at import until
ADR-2606022300 R1 activation and source-policy review gates are attested.

| Cell | Phase | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `akashi_source_registry` | periodic | `sourcePolicySnapshot` |
| `akashi_disclosure_fetch` | periodic | `adDisclosureSnapshot` |
| `akashi_normalize_creative` | continuous | advertiser / creative / delivery datoms |
| `akashi_landing_evidence` | rate-limited | `landingEvidence` |
| `akashi_cross_platform_link` | continuous | `adDisclosureLink` |
| `akashi_transparency_report` | periodic | `adTransparencyReport` |
| `akashi_malak_evidence_bridge` | event-gated | `malakEvidenceCandidate` |

## R0 Coverage

R0 coverage is schema, fixture, and reviewed-local-export coverage only. There
are no live platform collectors or collection jobs yet. All executable adapter
code is `.cljc`; Python is not an akashi adapter surface. See:

- `COVERAGE.md` — source / field coverage matrix
- `MATURITY.md` — maturity scorecard and R1 work list
- `registry/source-catalog.seed.json` — planning seed for Meta, X, LINE,
  Google/YouTube, TikTok, and regulator repositories
- `registry/source-policy-reviews.seed.json` — data-driven review state; Meta/X
  public-page scribe path is enabled, other live collection remains disabled
- `registry/source-policy-approval.schema.json` — future approval transaction
  shape with rollback-to-disabled requirement
- `adapters/regulator_bulk_fixture_parser.cljc` and `fixtures/regulator_bulk/`
  — local fixture parser only; no live collection
- `adapters/platform_ad_library_fixture_parser.cljc` and
  `fixtures/platform_ad_library/` — local Meta/Instagram and X ad-library
  fixture parser coverage; no live collection
- `adapters/ingest_platform_ad_library.cljc` — reviewed local export ingest CLI
  for Meta/Instagram/X-style public ad-library JSON snapshots; emits records,
  DataScript/kotoba tx EDN, or Datomic schema+scalar tx EDN without network
  access or writes unless `--out` is explicitly passed
- `adapters/public_page_scribe.cljc` — production public-information scribe for
  public pages and operator-saved public files; preserves raw scribe EDN and
  materializes parsed EDN under `data/scribe/` only when `--materialize` is passed
- `adapters/edn_export.cljc` — deterministic DataScript/kotoba EDN tx-data plus
  a Datomic schema/scalar-tx import bundle for validated akashi records;
  callers choose git, DataLad, or kotoba-git/kotoba-rad storage
- `adapters/edn_query.cljc` — fixture tx-data query helper for platform,
  advertiser, landing-domain, and count queries without a live DB; it also
  materializes the Datomic scalar tx bundle for the same queries
- `adapters/persist_fixture_edn.cljc` — materializes the deterministic tx-data
  plus a storage manifest under `data/` for git/DataLad/kotoba-rad handoff
- `data/akashi-platform-ad-library.fixture.tx.kotoba.edn` — materialized fixture
  tx-data artifact, readable as DataScript/kotoba EDN
- `data/akashi-platform-ad-library.fixture.datomic.edn` — materialized Datomic
  import bundle with schema and scalar `:db/add` tx-data
- `data/akashi-platform-ad-library.storage-manifest.edn` — storage handoff
  manifest naming the git path, CIDv1, DataLad save command, and akashi
  kotoba-rad identity journal
- `fixtures/closure/` — non-adjudicating link/report/malak-candidate closure
  fixtures
- `adapters/dry_run_fixtures.cljc` — local fixture dry-run CLI; no network access
  and no writes; `--emit-edn` prints validated EDN tx-data
- `fixtures/dry_run/summary.golden.json` — dry-run summary regression fixture
- `/00-contracts/lexicons/com/etzhayyim/akashi/` — 10 lexicon skeletons

## Persistence Status

As of 2026-07-10, the materialized fixture EDN is committed and pushed to:

- GitHub: `https://github.com/etzhayyim/root`
- Radicle: `rad:z2kYxHLH4E6pJHksgzAkRm9ztFgjC`

The persisted akashi dataset is the fixture dataset only:

- `data/akashi-platform-ad-library.fixture.tx.kotoba.edn`
- `data/akashi-platform-ad-library.fixture.datomic.edn`
- `data/akashi-platform-ad-library.storage-manifest.edn`
- CIDv1:
  `bafkreihcflz5xuinkb7ixurqccmlwl3gknc74uwthamg6vbwzhbsnmtqb4`
- kotoba-rad journal:
  `/80-data/kotoba-rad/akashi.identity.journal.edn`

No production `data/scribe/*.edn` public-page capture has been materialized in
this workspace yet. The public-page scribe is the production path, but it still
requires an operator-provided public URL or saved public page file.

## Immutable Gates

- passive public-source only
- source provenance mandatory
- non-adjudicating
- no political profiling
- no target lists
- open method notes
- ToS / robots / source-policy snapshot required
- no ad SDK or tracking pixels
- no commercial ad-intel product
- no private-person inference
- Murakumo-only inference
- transparent publication only
- malak bridge requires review
