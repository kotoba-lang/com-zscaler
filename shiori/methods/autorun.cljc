;; shiori 栞 — autonomous heartbeat: load the wellbecoming graph → append GROUND datoms.
(ns shiori.methods.autorun
  "autorun.cljc — shiori 栞 deterministic heartbeat (ADR-2606082102, inochi/tsugite pattern).

  One beat: load the human-Wellbecoming seed graph, build the GROUND EAVT datoms (cohort/
  detractor/driver/mitigator NODES + their detraction/relief :en/* 縁), and APPEND them as
  ONE content-addressed transaction to the append-only WELLBECOMING LEDGER (kotoba.cljc).
  prev-cid chaining keeps the ledger tamper-evident + resume-safe.

  GROUND ONLY: wellbecoming-burden / relief / relief-gap readouts are DERIVED (computed on
  read, N1/G2) and are NEVER persisted. Deterministic by construction: the caller supplies
  tx-id + as-of (no wall clock); nodes emit in EDN-read order (node-order) + edges content-
  stable → resume-safe. IDEMPOTENT-BY-CONTENT: a beat whose ground datoms equal the previous
  beat's is a NO-OP. No-server-key: appends to a local file only, no network I/O.
  G1: a RELIEF map at COHORT-AGGREGATE scale, never per-person affect (drivers are PATTERNS)."
