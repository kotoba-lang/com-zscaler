  "Validation of articulation->dict — the kami-biomech bridge that serializes a KamiArticulation
  into the string-keyed (WIT / Isaac) spec the kami-engine consumes. It was ISOLATED. Pins the
  kebab→snake key rename and the per-link / per-joint field mapping, so a regression that dropped or
  mis-keyed a field — which would silently feed the physics solver the wrong geometry — is caught."
