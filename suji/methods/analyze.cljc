(ns suji.methods.analyze
  "suji (筋) — end-to-end: laptop posture → bones load → muscle tension → 強張り. 1:1
  Clojure port of `methods/analyze.py` (ADR-2606061900). Stdlib only.

      workstation → posture (kinematics) → joint loads (static inverse dynamics)
                  → muscle tensions (%MVC) → stiffness map (Rohmert session dose)

  and reports the comparison (laptop-on-lap vs laptop-on-desk vs external-monitor-at-
  eye-level). The comparison is SELF-REFERENCED (G3); never a ranking of people, never a
  diagnosis (G1).

  NUMERICS (the whole ballgame): Python f-string `{x:.Nf}` is round-half-EVEN (Java's
  String.format is round-half-UP), so `fmt-f` reproduces it via exact BigDecimal.(double)
  + RoundingMode/HALF_EVEN — byte-identical to CPython. The Hansraj cervical-load / Hill
  %MVC / Rohmert dose figures all flow through this formatter.

  House style: pure fns; file I/O only at the #?(:clj) -main edge. A ScenarioResult is a
  kebab-keyword map. Strain sort is STABLE (ties keep Python list order)."
