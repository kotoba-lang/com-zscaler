(ns suji.methods.test-bridge-consistency
  "suji (筋) — SSoT-consistency tests. Partial 1:1 Clojure port of
  methods/test_bridge_consistency.py.

  DEFERRED (kami_biomech_bridge is NOT part of this Python→Clojure closure — it is the
  gated kami-genesis/Isaac articulation bridge, the noroshi-pattern WIT contract): the two
  bridge-solver tests `test_articulation_spec_well_formed` and
  `test_bridge_static_matches_load_solver` are not ported here. The latter's invariant —
  that the bridge's static moments equal load.py's closed-form moments — is the SAME single
  solver that this closure already exercises in test-load / test-datoms (the byte-identical
  cervical / shoulder / lumbosacral moments).

  The three SSoT drift-lock tests below need no bridge module and ARE ported: manifest cells
  ↔ disk, manifest lexicons ↔ disk, and seed reference resolution. Read with clojure.edn."
