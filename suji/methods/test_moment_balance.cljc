  "Validation of the gravitational joint-moment formulas in load.cljc — `shoulder-moment` and
  `lumbosacral-moment`, which `solve-posture-loads` composes but which (unlike `cervical-load`,
  pinned against the Hansraj 2014 table) had NO direct test coverage. A static gravitational joint
  moment is Σ(segment weight × horizontal lever-arm); this pins the analytical behaviour that the
  physics implies and a regression would break:
    - the moment grows monotonically as the limb/trunk flexes toward horizontal (the lever-arm
      grows as sin of the flexion angle);
    - the upright/neutral trunk carries EXACTLY zero L5/S1 moment (no horizontal lever);
    - supporting the forearms removes their lever and strictly lowers the shoulder moment;
    - a heavier carried head raises the L5/S1 moment at the same lean."
