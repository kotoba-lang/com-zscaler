  "suji (筋) — laptop-workstation → sagittal posture (joint angles). 1:1 Clojure port of
  `methods/posture.py` (ADR-2606061900). Stdlib only.

  The kinematic front-end: turns an ergonomic setup (where the screen is, where the
  keyboard is, whether the back is supported) into the joint angles of the sagittal chain.
  A documented, monotonic ergonomic model — NOT a biometric measurement (that is kizashi).
  All angles are degrees.

  House style: a Workstation / Posture is a kebab-keyword map; pure fns.")
