(ns suji.cells.strain-accumulate.state-machine
  "Phase state machine for the suji (筋) strain_accumulate cell — second coded cell.
  1:1 Clojure port of cells/strain_accumulate/state_machine.py (ADR-2606061900).

  Takes per-muscle tensions (%MVC, 緊張) + a held session duration and accumulates the
  Rohmert sustained-isometric dose into a 強張り (stiffness) map.

  Invariants enforced here:
    G1  — NON-DIAGNOSTIC (医師法 §17): mechanical fields only; clinical keys refused
          (the load_solve forbidden-clinical-keys reuse).
    G3  — SELF-REFERENCED: no population-ranking field (percentile/rank/cohort/vsOthers).
    G9  — kotoba-EAVT: outputs are shaped as strainReport Datoms (as-of; 非終末論).
    G10 — mechanically-grounded only: bands from strain/stiffness-band (Rohmert dose).

  Conventions mirror load_solve: dataclass StrainState → a plain map with string field
  keys; phase enum values stay strings; ValueError → ex-info; round-half-EVEN via py-round."
