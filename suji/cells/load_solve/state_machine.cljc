(ns suji.cells.load-solve.state-machine
  "Phase state machine for the suji (筋) load_solve cell — the coded heart.
  1:1 Clojure port of cells/load_solve/state_machine.py (ADR-2606061900).

  Drives one posture through static inverse dynamics → muscle %MVC, and enforces the
  load-bearing invariant: the result is NON-DIAGNOSTIC by construction.

  Invariants enforced here:
    G1  — NON-DIAGNOSTIC (医師法 §17): the emitted payload may carry mechanical fields
          only; any diagnosis/disease/prescription/treatment key is REFUSED.
    G9  — kotoba-EAVT: outputs are shaped as jointLoad + muscleTension Datoms.
    G10 — mechanically-grounded only: muscle groups from the Hill-model SPECS table.

  Conventions: dataclass LoadState → a plain map with the SAME string field keys the
  Python `__dict__` carries (`:loads` mirrors the `_loads` attr). Phase enum values stay
  strings; record/Datom payload keys keep the Python string keys; ValueError → ex-info.
  Numerics: Python round(v, n) is round-half-EVEN → `py-round`."
