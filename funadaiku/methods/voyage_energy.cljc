  "funadaiku 船大工 — Nagi 凪 class voyage energy-budget simulation.
  1:1 Clojure port of `methods/voyage_energy.py` (ADR-2606013400).

  Stdlib-only reduced-order analytic model of the zero-emission powertrain over a
  representative coastal voyage. Computes how much of the voyage propulsion + hotel
  energy is met by each source — wind-assist, solar, hydrogen fuel-cell (with battery
  buffering peaks) — and the resulting green-H2 demand.

  CONSTITUTIONAL (read before any change) — the whole point is G13 / N5:
    G13 (defining) — zero-emission propulsion ONLY: wind-assist + solar + H₂ fuel-cell +
      LFP battery + electric drive. There is NO fossil main or auxiliary engine. The
      powertrain has no fossil term — fossil energy is structurally UNREPRESENTABLE: the
      energy-share map carries exactly {wind_assist solar hydrogen_fuelcell} and never a
      \"fossil\" key, and `simulate` stamps :fossil_engine false. The renewable+H2 shares
      sum to 1.0 of total demand; there is no residual fossil channel they could leave open.
    G14 — H₂/NH₃/methanol must carry a green production chain-of-custody (well-to-wake);
      hydrogen made from fossil power is not zero-emission. The model reports green-H₂ kg.

  House style: Python ':…' keyword strings stay strings; pure fns; file I/O only at the
  #?(:clj) -main edge. Float formatting matches Python's {x:.Nf} (and the lambda
  pct = f\"{x*100:.1f}%\") exactly via HALF_EVEN on the exact BigDecimal of the double
  (Java String.format is HALF_UP — so we never use it for the energy figures). Math/ maps
  pow/etc last-ULP identical on the JVM. The energy-balance numbers (kWh, SoC shares, range)
  are byte-identical to python3. Portable .cljc."
  (:require [clojure.string :as str]))

;; ── float formatting (HALF_EVEN on the exact double, matching Python {x:.Nf}) ──
;; Python's format() / round() use round-half-to-even on the exact binary value of the
;; double; Java's String.format("%.Nf") is HALF_UP, so it would diverge on ties. We build
;; the BigDecimal of the *exact* double and setScale with HALF_EVEN, byte-for-byte matching
;; CPython. (BigDecimal/valueOf would use the SHORTEST decimal — wrong; (BigDecimal. dbl)
;; is the exact value — right.)
