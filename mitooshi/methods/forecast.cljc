  "mitooshi 見通し — leak-free rolling-origin forecasting + online-recalibrated backtest.
  1:1 port of methods/forecast.py (ADR-2606051800). Composes the score primitives (CRPS / PIT /
  climatology / persistence / skill / calibration, mitooshi.methods.score) into per-series Gaussian
  forecasts and a ROLLING-ORIGIN, leak-free backtest (G5). backtest-calibrated additionally applies
  the online_update cell's learned bias/inflation (apply-correction) using ONLY past residuals.
  The Python __main__ CLI (load-edn + argv dispatch) is the omitted I/O leg; the importlib load of
  the online_update cell becomes a direct require."
