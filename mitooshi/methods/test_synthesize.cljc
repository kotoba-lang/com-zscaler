  "Cross-language oracle tests for mitooshi.methods.synthesize — the Clojure port
  of methods/synthesize.py.

  Ported 1:1 from the REAL Python test_synthesize.py (the cross-language oracle):
  every composite assertion runs over the committed Datom artifacts
  (chokepoint-trail + chokepoint-forecast .kotoba.edn) through the already-ported
  analyze/load-edn-file, so any divergence in the watari+watatsuna+mitooshi fusion
  or the scale-free attention blend fails here."
