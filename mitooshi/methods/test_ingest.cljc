(ns mitooshi.methods.test-ingest
  "Cross-language oracle tests for mitooshi.methods.ingest — the Clojure port of
  methods/ingest.py (the pure `normalize` core).

  Ported from the REAL Python test_ingest.py: the 5 normalize-logic assertions run
  over the same committed data/ingest/sample-batch.json (2 public series +
  1 proprietary-terminal series refused), so any divergence in the G4 source
  membrane, the keyword normalization, or the append-only obs ordering fails here.

  The Python test's two --live cases (6 & 7) exercise main's CLI G10 gate via
  subprocess; main is omitted from this port per the convention (the G10 live-fetch
  gate stays in the Python entry point), so those CLI cases are out of scope here."
